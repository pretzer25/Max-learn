led by the sons of liberty, wanted the ships to return to england. they refused the unloading of the ships’ tea cargo. massachusetts lieutenant governor thomas hutchinson refused to let the ships return. on dec. 16, 1773, the sons of liberty dumped 340 chests of tea into the boston harbor in protest. boston wasn’t the only city to have a tea party. several other cities in the colonies protested the tea tax in a similar manner. captain alexander curling of the ship london brought a cargo of tea to port in charleston, south carolina. those responsible for receiving the delivery refused it. on december 22, a week after the boston tea party, a committee of colonists told curling to return the tea to england. the captain refused. the customs collector then had the 257 tea chests seized for unpaid import taxes. the tea was unloaded and stored away. on christmas day, 1773, the british ship polly docked at chester, pennsylvania, with 698 cases of tea. the ship’s captain, samuel ayres, was escorted into the city. there, he was met by a committee of men who represented roughly 8,000 citizens of the city. they told him to return the tea to england. they threatened ayres and anyone who tried to bring the ship into philadelphia or attempted to accept the shipment. the polly sailed away without putting into port. in april 1774, the nancy was commanded by captain benjamin lockyer. the ship dropped anchor at sandy hook, new york. its cargo consisted of 698 chests of tea. the merchants of the city refused to accept the tea because it would “expose so considerable a property to inevitable  destruction.” they advised lockyer to return to england. some of the sons of liberty escorted lockyer into new york city, where he agreed to return to england with the tea. four days after the events in sandy hook, the ship london arrived in new york under the command of captain chambers. the london previously landed at charleston, south carolina, in december. although chambers protested that he had no tea aboard, the sons of liberty received word that he was smuggling 18 chests of tea. chambers was taken into custody, and members of the sons of liberty searched the ship. they discovered the tea chests, broke them open, and dumped the tea into the river. they then brought the broken chests back to the city, where they were used to light bonfires in the streets. in october 1774, a british newspaper reported that “many ladies of this province [north carolina] have determined to give a memorable proof of their patriotism.” these women had resolved not to drink any more tea or use any british cloth to protest taxation without representation. giving up tea, which was a part of everyday life, showed just how angry they were with the english government. this event became known as the edenton tea party.  during the 1760s and 1770s, colonists in america and the british parliament were in a constant struggle over taxes. in 1765, parliament passed the stamp act. this act placed a tax on all paper documents. it was the first tax placed directly on the american colonists by parliament. the townshend acts, passed in 1767, put taxes on many household items. this included paint, glass, and tea. colonists didn’t want to pay taxes on items sold by the british. they decided to boycott, or refuse to buy, the items. many colonists of boston, massachusetts, were among those who greatly opposed the new acts. to enforce the townshend acts, parliament sent 4,000 soldiers to boston. tensions were high between the colonists and british soldiers. soldiers were quartered in private homes and public buildings. they were even taking extra jobs around the town that could have been given to unemployed colonials. on march 5, 1770, british soldiers fired into an angry crowd. no one knows for sure if the first shot was fired on purpose, but it was followed by additional shots fired into the crowd. two men were killed, and three who were wounded later died. the angry patriots called it the boston massacre. the colonists continued to boycott british goods, which worked in their favor. the townshend acts were repealed, or reversed, in 1773. parliament still insisted they had the privilege of taxing the colonies. to make this point, parliament passed the tea act in 1773. american colonists loved to drink tea and it was a huge part of their culture. growing, buying, and selling tea became a major industry in the british empire. before the passage of the tea act, tea was imported to america by  individual merchants. chests of tea were auctioned to merchants in london. the auctions were open to all businessmen, who bought the tea at competitive prices. the merchants paid the tax and included the tax in the price they charged for the tea. the tea act took away all competitive buying from merchants. it meant that all the profits made from the tea would be given to one company: the east india company and their chosen agents in the colonies. this created a monopoly, meaning no one else was selling the same product. the east india company was directly influenced by the british government. boston, new york, philadelphia, and charleston were selected as places for tea delivery. the royal governors of the colonies selected the agents who would purchase and resell the tea. governors selected friends and men loyal to the king to be tea agents. the colonists were angry. they saw this tax as a way for people loyal to the king to get rich and make the colonists pay for it.  week 9 of 32 • page 3  a society
